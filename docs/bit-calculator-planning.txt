Goal:
Allow the user to perform bit manipulation operations on positive numbers using the command-line interface in a 32-bit range.

Requirements:
- provide menu to user for calculator operation choices
	> Bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, or Left/Right Shifts
	> Conversion: Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal
- take input from the user
- perform the requested calculation
- print out the result of the calculation 
- program continues until the user chooses to exit the program
- comments for each function
- input validation for all operations

Tools, Targets:
OS: Linux, macOS
Tools: <cstdint> (fixed-width integers)

Breaking problem down:
✅ >> Start calculator loop

✅ - Get menu choice from user
	- Display menu
		1) Bitwise operation (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, or Left/Right Shifts)
        2) Number conversion (Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal)
        3) Exit
	- Get menu choice from user
		- integer value (ex: 1, 2, or 3)

1) Perform bitwise operation
	✅ - Get first number to perform operation on (decimal, hex, binary)
		> positive numbers only
	
	✅ - Get operation choice from user
		> AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), or right Shifts (>>)
		
	✅ - Get second number to perform operation on (unless NOT is chosen)
		
	- Perform operation
		> AND (&)
			result = operand1 & operand2;
		> OR (|)
			result = operand1 | operand2;
		> XOR (^)
			result = operand1 ^ operand2;
		> NOT (~)
			result = ~operand;
		> Left Shift (<<)
			result = operand << numberOfBits;
		> Right Shift (>>)
			result = operand >> numberOfBits;
			
	- Print calculation results to console in sentence form
		> ex: "Result of 0x5 AND 3
				decimal: 1
				hex: 0x1
				binary: 0001"
		> ex: "Result of 5 left shift 1
				decimal: 10
				hex: A
				binary: 1010"
		> ex: "The result of NOT 0b0101
				decimal: 4294967290
				hex: FFFFFFFA
				binary:	1111 1111 1111 1111
						1111 1111 1111 1010"

2) Perform number system conversion
	- Display conversion choices
		Convert from:
			1) Decimal
			2) Binary
			3) Hexadecimal
		Convert #Make this smart, only show relevant choices. From Decimal to Binary or Hex only.
			1) Decimal
			2) Binary
			3) Hexadecimal
	- Get conversion choice from user
	- Get number to convert
	- Perform conversion
		> decimal to binary
		> decimal to hex
		> binary to decimal
		> binary to hex
		> hex to decimal
		> hex to binary
	- Print result
		> ex: "100 decimal is 0110 0100 in binary."
		> ex: "9EA2 hexadecimal is 40610 in decimal."

Sequence of events:
Display calculator menu
Get choice of operation or conversion
	> operation
		get first positive number
		get operation
		get second number (if not NOT op)
		perform operation on number(s)
		print result
	> conversion
		get convert from
		get convert to
		get number
		perform conversion
		print result
Ask to continue with another operation
	> Y: continue calculator loop
	> N: end program
